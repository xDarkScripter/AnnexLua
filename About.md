# AnnexLua

AnnexLua is a modular set of libraries intended to enhance the experience, efficiency, and organization of scripting. It was developed for the purpose of providing functions and other variables that do nott currently exist in RBX.Lua. Some of the content provided will not work in pure Lua, only RBX.Lua.


### Libraries

The libraries include the original content of RBX.Lua's global namespace and other functions and variables. They can be imported into the environment or defined. See documentation for more information.


### Status

- Work In Progress


### Developers
